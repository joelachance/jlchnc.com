# Everything is a Prompt

If you've written documentation or error messages recently, the idea may have
crossed your mind that people aren't going to be reading this, but an LLM. 

This is ultimately a good thing! Even for developers that aren't using AI,
prompts tend to be simpler and explicit, which is foundational in Zen of Python:

```bash
> python
> import this
```

This means that it benefits developers and LLMs alike.

This might feel scary, since your job might be to monitor your logs,
but it's a good thing, and here's why:

You probably didn't want to read those logs in the first place!
And you probably didn't want to read the docs for that library you're using, either.

The more we can give to LLMs, the more they can automate for us.

The future might not go this direction, but I'd like to think about this optimistically:
that's more coffee breaks, more time with family, more time to do what you love.
